Kubernetes Event Grid Bridge is planning on providing a range of consumption-friendly events allowing you to extend Kubernetes.

For now, we allow you to process raw Kubernetes event without any translation - Just like we got it from Kubernetes!

Do you have event requests? [Let us know](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/k8s-event-grid-bridge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=event-type%2Cfeature-request&template=Event_type_request.md)!
