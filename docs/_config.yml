# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: Kubernetes Event Grid Bridge

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A simple event bridge for Kubernetes native events forwarding CloudEvents v1.0 compliant events to Azure Event Grid into Microsoft Azure.
  
  The bridge is not in charge of acquiring the events from Kubernetes, but you can use tools such as Opsgenie's Kubernetes Event Exporter and forward them to the bridge.
